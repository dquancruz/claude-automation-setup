# tools/cursor/enable.sh — Cursor adapter (Fase 3, AI-SETUP-PLAN-v2.md)
# ============================================================================
# Same thin-wrapper style as tools/claude/enable.sh, but Cursor's actual
# capabilities are different (see tools/cursor/capabilities.yaml) — per
# AI-SETUP-PLAN-v2.md section 5.3, Cursor has NO global scope for agents or
# skills (Custom Modes and skills are project-scoped only; there is no
# ~/.cursor/ equivalent for them). This script does not invent one.
#
# What "enabling Cursor" means today:
#
#   --scope=global -> nothing real to install for agents/skills (see below).
#                     MCP does have a real global scope (~/.cursor/mcp.json)
#                     but wiring that up is Fase 5's generalized
#                     install-global.sh, not this adapter — not implemented
#                     here to avoid a one-off special case.
#
#   --scope=repo   -> renders registry/rules/*.md  -> .cursor/rules/*.mdc
#                     and registry/agents/*.md     -> .cursor/modes/*.md
#                     into the CURRENT directory (must be run FROM the
#                     target repo — same convention as setup-repo.sh /
#                     tools/claude/enable.sh, no path argument).
#                     AGENTS.md and .mcp.json are tool-agnostic and already
#                     handled by setup-repo.sh — not duplicated here.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/cursor/enable.sh --scope=global
#   cd /path/to/target-repo && /path/to/claude-automation-setup/tools/cursor/enable.sh --scope=repo
#   tools/cursor/enable.sh                 # defaults to --scope=repo
# ============================================================================
