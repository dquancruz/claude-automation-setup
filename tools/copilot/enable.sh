# tools/copilot/enable.sh — GitHub Copilot adapter (Fase 4, AI-SETUP-PLAN-v2.md)
# ============================================================================
# Same thin-wrapper style as tools/claude/enable.sh and tools/cursor/enable.sh,
# but Copilot is tier C (docs/AI-SETUP-PLAN-v2.md section 2.2): there is no
# native agent/skill/rule concept, just one always-loaded instructions file.
# All the rendering logic lives in lib/condense.mjs (the shared, generic
# engine — see AI-SETUP-PLAN-v2.md section 6); this script is just the
# calling convention + target-path wiring for Copilot specifically, per
# tools/copilot/capabilities.yaml.
#
# What "enabling Copilot" means today, per tools/copilot/capabilities.yaml:
#
#   --scope=global -> nothing real to install. Copilot has no
#                     ~/.github/copilot-instructions.md equivalent (Copilot's
#                     personal-instructions feature lives in GitHub account
#                     Settings, not a file this setup can write) — same
#                     "not automated" shape as Cursor's global_scope:
#                     manual-only User Rules (section 5.3). Not implemented
#                     here to avoid inventing an unverified mechanism.
#
#   --scope=repo   -> runs lib/condense.mjs against this setup's registry/
#                     and writes the condensed result to
#                     .github/copilot-instructions.md in the CURRENT
#                     directory (must be run FROM the target repo — same
#                     convention as setup-repo.sh / tools/claude/enable.sh /
#                     tools/cursor/enable.sh, no path argument).
#
# Usage:
#   tools/copilot/enable.sh --scope=global
#   cd /path/to/target-repo && /path/to/claude-automation-setup/tools/copilot/enable.sh --scope=repo
#   tools/copilot/enable.sh                 # defaults to --scope=repo
